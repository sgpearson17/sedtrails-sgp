## Configuring a Simulation

Simulations are configured using YAML files. These files define the parameters and settings for running SedTRAILS simulations, including input data, particle properties, and output options.

For a detailed reference of all available parameters, please refer to the [Simulation Parameters Reference](../references/simulation-params.md).

`seeding.release_start` is interpreted relative to `general.input_model.reference_date`.
For example, if `reference_date` is `2016-09-21 19:20:00` and `release_start` is `2016-09-21 19:30:00`, particles are released 600 seconds after simulation start.

The `domain` section is optional. If you do not need a custom extent, island/cutout masking, or open/land boundary overrides, omit `domain` entirely and SedTRAILS uses the active grid from the input model. If a `domain` section is present, it must define the active extent with exactly one method: either `domain.pol_file` or both `domain.subset_x` and `domain.subset_y`.

For FM and SFINCS models, the optional `domain.inner_boundary_pol_files` setting can use Tekal polygons to mask islands/cutouts. For FM, SFINCS, and XBeach models, `domain.boundary_class_pol_files` can classify boundary crossings as `open` or `land`. These settings modify the active extent; they do not define an extent by themselves. Boundary-class polygons select active boundary edges by edge midpoint. Drawing rule: boundary-class polygons may be wider than a thin line as long as they only contain the intended edge midpoints, and do not include neighboring or unrelated boundary-edge midpoints. See the domain section of the parameter reference for the full behavior.

![Domain polygon definition schematic](../_static/img/domain-polygon-definitions.png)

This conceptual schematic shows the roles of the different polygon settings. The outer polygon or rectangular subset defines the active extent, inner-boundary polygons remove cutouts, and boundary-class polygons classify active boundary edges by midpoint.

The "regular closed boundary" is defined by the edge of the "active domain", and comes from:
-	the input model grid, if domain is omitted
-	the clipped/masked domain from `domain.pol_file`, if supplied
-	the rectangular clipped domain from `subset_x` + `subset_y`, if supplied
plus any holes/cutouts created by `inner_boundary_pol_files`

After that is settled, the `boundary_class_pol_files.open` and `.land` only override parts of that active boundary by testing boundary-edge midpoints, and set the particle behaviour according to that.

### Choosing a Tracer Mode

Each population must define exactly one tracer method under `particles.populations[].tracer_methods`.

- There is **no default tracer method**. You must explicitly choose one of: `vanwesten`, `soulsby`, or `passive_tracer`.
- For `passive_tracer`, `flow_field_name` is optional and defaults to `depth_avg_flow_velocity`.
- For `vanwesten` and `soulsby`, you should provide `flow_field_name` explicitly.
- If you use `passive_tracer`, set `particle_type: passive`.
- If you use `passive_tracer`, `transport_probability` must be `no_probability` (the default). Using `stochastic_transport` or `reduced_velocity` raises a configuration error.
- If you use `passive_tracer`, omit `seeding.burial_depth`. Passive tracer does not support burial depth and will raise a configuration error if it is set.

Use the following minimal keyword blocks inside each population:

```yaml
tracer_methods:
  vanwesten:
    flow_field_name:
      - bed_load_velocity
      - suspended_velocity
```

```yaml
tracer_methods:
  soulsby:
    flow_field_name:
      - grain_velocity
```

```yaml
tracer_methods:
  passive_tracer: {}
```

Minimal passive population example:

```yaml
- name: passive_population
  particle_type: passive
  characteristics:
    diffusion_coefficient: 0.0
  tracer_methods:
    passive_tracer: {}
  seeding:
    release_start: 2016-09-21 19:30:00
    quantity: 1
    strategy:
      random:
        bbox: "39400,16800 40600,17800"
        seed: 42
        nlocations: 10
```

You can also set an explicit passive flow field:

```yaml
tracer_methods:
  passive_tracer:
    flow_field_name:
      - depth_avg_flow_velocity
```

Repository examples by mode:

- Van Westen: `examples/sedtrails-example.yaml`
- Soulsby: `examples/config.example_soulsby.yaml`
- Passive tracer: `examples/sedtrails-example-passive.yaml` (FM) and `examples/config.example_sfincs.yaml` (SFINCS)

Run any mode the same way by selecting the config file:

```bash
sedtrails run -c ./examples/sedtrails-example.yaml
sedtrails run -c ./examples/config.example_soulsby.yaml
sedtrails run -c ./examples/config.example_sfincs.yaml
```

## Running a Simulation

The following steps run the tracked example configuration at `examples/sedtrails-example.yaml`.

:::important
Make sure you have SedTRAILS installed. If you haven't installed it yet, please refer to the [Installation Guide](./installation.md).

The example configuration is part of the repository under `examples/sedtrails-example.yaml`.
:::

1. Download the dataset file named `inlet_sedtrails.nc` from [this link](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/VUGKZm7QexAXuD9?path=%2Fdfm).

2. From the repository root, create a `sample-data` directory and save the downloaded file there.

```bash
mkdir -p sample-data
```

3. In `examples/sedtrails-example.yaml`, set `inputs.data` to the downloaded file.

```yaml
inputs:
  data: ./sample-data/inlet_sedtrails.nc
```

4. Run the model using the following command:

```bash
sedtrails run -c ./examples/sedtrails-example.yaml
```

::: note
The simulation will start running, and a dashboard will open if it is enabled in the configuration. Output is written to `examples/results/sedtrails_results.nc` unless you change `outputs.directory`.

## Restarting a Simulation

If a simulation is interrupted or needs to continue from a specific point, you can generate a restart configuration that uses the last valid particle positions from a previous run as seed points for a new simulation.

### When to Use Restart

The restart feature is useful when:
- A long simulation crashes or is stopped before completion
- You want to continue a simulation without losing progress
- You need to extend a finished simulation with additional runtime
- You want to restart from intermediate results to test different transport parameters

### Prerequisites

To restart a simulation, you need:
1. A NetCDF output file from a previous SedTRAILS run (e.g., `sedtrails_results.nc`)
2. The original simulation configuration file used to generate that output
3. Both files must be accessible from your working directory

### Generating a Restart Configuration

The restart process automatically:
- Extracts the **last valid particle position** for each particle in the NetCDF output
- Filters particles to include only those that were alive and in-domain at their last position
- **Computes remaining runtime** based on the original simulation duration and elapsed time (see "Edge Case - Full Completion" in [Notes and Tips](#notes-and-tips))
- Generates per-population seed point CSV files
- Creates a new YAML configuration file ready to run

#### Command Syntax

```bash
sedtrails config restart -f <results_file> -c <base_config> -o <output_config> [--seed-dir <seed_directory>]
```

**Parameters:**
- `-f, --file`: Path to the NetCDF results file from the previous run (default: `sedtrails_results.nc`)
- `-c, --config`: Path to the original YAML configuration file (default: `sedtrails.yml`)
- `-o, --output`: Path where the new restart YAML will be written (default: `sedtrails-restart.yaml`)
- `--seed-dir`: (Optional) Custom directory for generated seed point CSV files. If not specified, defaults to `<output_config_directory>/<output_config_stem>_seeds/`

#### Example: Basic Restart

If your previous run output is in `./results/sedtrails_results.nc` and the config was `./examples/sedtrails-example.yaml`:

```bash
sedtrails config restart -f ./results/sedtrails_results.nc \
                        -c ./examples/sedtrails-example.yaml \
                        -o ./examples/restart.yaml
```

This command will:
1. Read the last valid position of each particle from `sedtrails_results.nc`
2. Calculate the elapsed time and remaining duration from the original run
3. Generate seed point files in `./examples/restart_seeds/` (one CSV per population)
4. Create `./examples/restart.yaml` with:
   - Updated `time.start` set to when the restart will begin
   - Adjusted `time.duration` set to the remaining time from the original run
   - Each population's seeding strategy replaced with `file_points` referencing the generated CSV files

#### Example Output

The generated restart YAML will look similar to this:

```yaml
general:
  input_model:
    format: fm_netcdf
    reference_date: '1970-01-01'
    morfac: 1
    coordinate_system: auto
    source_crs: EPSG:4326
    metric_crs: auto_utm
inputs:
  data: ./sample-data/inlet_sedtrails.nc
time:
  start: '2016-09-27 03:22:48'          # Updated to last valid timestamp
  timestep: 60S
  duration: 4D15H57M12S                 # Adjusted to remaining time from original 10D run
particles:
  populations:
  - name: population_1
    particle_type: sand
    seeding:
      strategy:
        file_points:
          path: ./examples/restart_seeds/population_1.restart_points.csv
          x_col: x
          y_col: y
          has_header: true
```

The seed point CSV files contain particle coordinates from the last valid timestep:

```text
x,y
40293.54196405,17547.72446346
39626.62407569,17560.15080805
40360.98655363,17704.94651676
```

### Running the Restart

Once the restart configuration is generated, run it like any other simulation:

```bash
sedtrails run -c ./examples/restart.yaml
```

The new simulation will:
- Start from the particle positions saved in the seed point files
- Use the adjusted `time.duration` to simulate only the remaining time
- Output results to the same or a different output directory (configured in the restart YAML)

(notes-and-tips)=
### Notes and Tips

- **Particle Retention**: Only particles that were alive and within the domain at their last position are included in the restart. Particles that escaped the domain or were trapped will not be restarted.

- **Reference Date Handling**: If your original configuration used `general.input_model.reference_date`, the restart YAML preserves that reference date and computes `time.start` from output times using the same time origin. Newer output files can also provide explicit `reference_date` or `time_units` metadata.

- **Forcing Window Validation**: A generated restart must start inside the original input forcing window. If the output time would create a restart such as `1970-01-01 04:16:40` for forcing that starts in 2016, restart generation raises an error instead of writing an invalid YAML.

- **Relative Paths**: Generated seed file paths in the restart YAML are relative to the current working directory (using `./` prefix). Make sure to run the restart from the same directory where the YAML was generated, or update the paths accordingly.

- **Duration Precision**: The remaining duration is calculated to second precision and formatted in SedTRAILS duration syntax (e.g., `4D15H57M12S` = 4 days, 15 hours, 57 minutes, 12 seconds).

- **Edge Case - Full Completion**: If the output file shows that the original simulation ran to completion (all particles reached the end time), the restart will report "No remaining duration left" and decline to create a restart file.
