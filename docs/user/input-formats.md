# Input Formats

This page collects the practical differences between the input model formats SedTRAILS can work with. The goal is to document the assumptions that matter for loading data, choosing variables, and interpreting model output.

Note: the format converter interpolates data at all U/V points to cell centers and flattens structured grids to 1D spatial vectors so downstream modules can treat all inputs consistently.

SedTRAILS keeps particle input/output coordinates in the model's native coordinate system. For geometric work such as triangulation, point location, boundary checks, and CFL spacing, longitude/latitude grids are projected internally through `pyproj` to a metric CRS. The converter infers this from NetCDF coordinate attributes such as `degrees_east` and `degrees_north`; set `general.input_model.coordinate_system: geographic` when those attributes are missing. By default SedTRAILS uses `metric_crs: auto_utm` to choose a local UTM EPSG zone from the grid, or you can set an explicit projected CRS such as `EPSG:32631`.

## D-Flow FM

D-Flow FM input is the most direct path through SedTRAILS. The seeding GUI and the simulation workflow expect a NetCDF-based flow field with cell-center coordinates and a bathymetry variable that can be used to preview the domain.

Typical variables used by the GUI and runtime are:

- `net_xcc`
- `net_ycc`
- `bedlevel` or `bed_level`

## Delft3D 4

Delft3D 4 input is not currently a supported SedTRAILS runtime format. The repository contains a Delft3D 4 converter scaffold, but it raises `NotImplementedError`, and `d3d4` is not a valid value for `general.input_model.format`.

Convert Delft3D 4 results to one of the supported NetCDF-based formats before using them with SedTRAILS.

## XBeach

We wrote this explicitly to work with `*_mean` variables only. Otherwise, especially in surfbeat mode, the global output provides randomly-phased long wave flow fields, which don't provide meaningful information on flow or transport for SedTRAILS- just instantaneous snapshots. This means that we work with `zb_mean`, which is the average bed level over that time avg interval (defined by `tintg` in the params file).

The variables expected in the output section of the XBeach `params.txt` file are:

```text
nmeanvar =13
thetamean
zb
hh
ue
ve
taubx
tauby
Susg
Svsg
Subg
Svbg
ua
cctot
```

In practice, the GUI uses the spatial coordinates from `globalx` and `globaly`, and bathymetry preview defaults to `zb_mean` when it is available.

XBeach coordinate names alone do not prove whether a grid is projected or longitude/latitude. If `globalx`/`globaly` do not carry longitude/latitude units, configure `general.input_model.coordinate_system` explicitly.

## SFINCS

SFINCS input is supported through the same general configuration flow, but it has its own conventions for reference dates, grid layout, and file naming. The main thing to watch is whether the file contains the coordinate and time variables required by the converter and by any visualization path you plan to use.

For configuration details, start from the SFINCS example and the converter-specific documentation, then verify the exact variable names in your NetCDF file.
